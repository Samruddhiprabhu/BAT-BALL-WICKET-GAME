This is a web-based game where the user competes against a computer in a simplified version of "rock, paper, scissors" using three items: BAT, BALL, and WICKET. The game allows the user to choose one of the three items by clicking corresponding buttons with images. The computer randomly selects one of the items, and the outcome is determined based on predefined rules:

Tie: If both the user and computer select the same item.
Computer Wins: If the computer's choice beats the user's choice.
User Wins: If the user's choice beats the computer's choice.
The result is displayed dynamically on the webpage. A reset button is available to restart the game, clearing previous results and choices. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the logic for random selection, result evaluation, and user interaction handled through JavaScript. This simple game provides an engaging and interactive experience while demonstrating basic web development concepts.
